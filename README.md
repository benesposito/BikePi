# BikePi
BikePi is my attempt at using a RaspberryPi to give directions on a bike in the form of an LED ring, with directions being sent over bluetooth from an android phone.


Directions was created in May of 2017

BluetoothTest was created in December of 2017


Both were worked on until I got to working on bluetooth, which I would work on for a few weeks until moving onto another project. Still have failed to set up bluetooth. Maybe I'll get interested again and try again soon.
